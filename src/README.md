Fun fun fun! This was waaaay more intimidating on the paper than what it turned out to be. At least so far.
I had trouble understanding ES6 modules. Turns out they're fairly simple. Webpack was messing with my head. Starting to
understand it too. Even though just the idea of making config files from the scratch myself seems impossible at this point.

DOM manipulation at this point is easy, although it can be a drag.. I do encounter bugs in the code constantly but they're always easy and fast to fix. It's just
that doing the HTML this way is so much more complicated that it opens doors for many more mistakes to be made. That's all.

Was afraid how to link the sub pages. I didn't want to take the easy route of just loading UI and layout and everything every time the
links are being clicked. Turns out it was easy. Very intuitive, actually. Worked just the way I had hoped for. Simple eventListeners.
