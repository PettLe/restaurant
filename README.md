Fun fun fun! This was waaaay more intimidating on the paper than what it turned out to be. At least so far.
I had trouble understanding ES6 modules. Turns out they're fairly simple. Webpack was messing with my head. Starting to
understand it too. Even though just the idea of making config files from the scratch myself seems impossible at this point.

DOM manipulation at this point is easy, although it can be a drag.. I do encounter bugs in the code constantly but they're always easy and fast to fix. It's just
that doing the HTML this way is so much more complicated that it opens doors for many more mistakes to be made. That's all.

Was afraid how to link the sub pages. I didn't want to take the easy route of just loading UI and layout and everything every time the
links are being clicked. Turns out it was easy. Very intuitive, actually. Worked just the way I had hoped for. Simple eventListeners.

Had trouble rendering menu section. It would have been easy if I just manually did all the divs and contents, but I wanted to take the
extra step (and practice) generating them using a for loop. Ended up using three separate arrays there. Object would have been a lot cleaner
way to solve this for sure, but I guess it's still something. Maybe I'll try later.

EDIT: the project is now ready. Only thing left to do is push it to the GitHub. That takes few extra steps, but if there's no further edits, consider it being
easily done.
Little things I could fix later: clean up the code even more. Especially the CSS is not as organized as I would like it to be. But hardly matters with project
this scale.
The footer Copyright text sometimes laps other content. It would be nice to fix.

The big thing I would like to change later is responsiveness with smaller screens. But I won't stress it too much, after all, it hasn't yet been in the Curriculum.

All in all, fun project! Not as hard as I was afraid of. Made me feel like I've learned a lot of new!
